##PDB statistics
Here we inspect the types of structures in the main database for 3D biomolecular data - the PDB

Q1: Determine the percentage of structures solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy. 

st: go to the rcsb.org website > analyze > PDB statistics > Experimental method and molecular type (download CVS and then import it, and read the stats.)

```{r}
# read in file

stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
stats

  
#dolar $ sign to access an specific column

#calculate percentage values asked for each "method"

ans <- stats$Total / sum(stats$Total) *100
names(ans) <- rownames(stats)
round(ans, 2)
