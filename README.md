This is my classwork from [BIMM-143](https://bioboot.github.io/bimm143_W20/) W 2020 at UCSD. 

## Look on the right side... the arrow pointing up... when I click it it asked me for my username and password in github... it will automatically export everything to the website and can see the changes there... 
PUSH buttom to GITHUB

>>> Going back to the github website If I click on the right corner the tiny pencil I can see it as a console... and add notes at the bottom... when clicking the downwards arrow I can add info from the website to here...
